# keylogger
Keylogger for linux written in python

=====

This linux keylogger is loosely based off of the one linked [here](https://github.com/amoffat/pykeylogger).



clean.py is an example script for creating more human-readable output.  Running keylogger.py will log all keystrokes to '/var/log/area.log' by default.
